**Course Description:**

This course introduces students to data science techniques using Python to address real-world social problems. It emphasizes ethical considerations in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Students learn to apply data science tools for social good through hands-on projects involving data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The course culminates in a collaborative project with a local non-profit organization, providing students with practical experience in using data to create positive social impact. Students develop critical thinking skills to evaluate the potential biases and limitations of data-driven solutions.

**Learning Objectives:**

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

*   Demonstrate proficiency in using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
*   Apply ethical principles and practices to data collection, analysis, and interpretation, recognizing potential biases and limitations.
*   Formulate data-driven solutions to address specific social problems, such as poverty, inequality, or environmental issues.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness and impact of data science projects on communities and organizations.
*   Collaborate effectively in teams to design, implement, and present data science projects for social good.
*   Communicate technical findings clearly and concisely to both technical and non-technical audiences.
*   Critically assess the role of data science in promoting social justice and equity.

**Required Materials:**

*   [List Required Textbooks Here - e.g., "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas]
*   Access to a computer with Python 3.x installed (Anaconda distribution recommended).
*   Internet access.

**Course Schedule (Weekly Topics):**
