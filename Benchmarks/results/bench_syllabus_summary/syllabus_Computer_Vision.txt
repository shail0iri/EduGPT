Okay, here's a course syllabus draft based on the conversation, designed for a "Computer Vision for Autonomous Robotics" course.  I've tried to include detail where the conversation provided it, and made reasonable assumptions to fill in the rest.  You'll likely need to adjust it to fit your specific needs (grading, textbook, prerequisites etc.):

**Course Schedule & Topics:**

**Module 1: Image Formation and Basic Image Processing** (X weeks)

*   **Topics:**
    *   Camera Models and Geometry: Pinhole camera model, camera parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic), camera calibration.
    *   Image Representation and Data Structures: Image formats, pixel representation, image data structures (e.g., matrices).
    *   Basic Image Filtering: Linear filters (e.g., Gaussian blur, mean filter), edge detection filters (e.g., Sobel, Canny), and morphological operations.
    *   Color Spaces: RGB, HSV, and grayscale color spaces, and color space conversions.
*   **Assignments/Exercises:**
    *   Implement and compare different blurring techniques (e.g., Gaussian blur, median blur) on noisy images using OpenCV (`cv::GaussianBlur()`, `cv::medianBlur()`). Analyze their effect on noise reduction.
    *   Implement edge detection using Sobel and Canny edge detectors using OpenCV (`cv::Sobel()`, `cv::Canny()`). Experiment with different parameters and analyze the impact on edge detection results.
    *   Implement morphological operations (e.g., erosion, dilation, opening, closing) using OpenCV (`cv::erode()`, `cv::dilate()`, `cv::morphologyEx()`) to remove noise and enhance image features.

**Final Project:**

*   **Description:** Students will work on a final project that integrates computer vision techniques with ROS to solve a robotics problem.
*   **Example Project:** ROS-Based Object Following with YOLO
    *   **Objective:** Create a ROS node that uses YOLO to detect a specific object (e.g., a ball, a box) in the simulated robot's camera feed and then commands the robot to follow that object.
    *   **Simulation Environment:** Use Gazebo as the robot simulator and create a simple environment with the target object.
    *   **ROS Node:** Develop a ROS node that subscribes to the robot's camera feed (e.g., using the `gazebo_ros_camera` plugin).
    *   **YOLO Integration:** Integrate YOLO object detection into the ROS node using OpenCV's DNN module. The node processes the camera feed, detects the target object, and determines its position in the image.
    *   **Control Logic:** Implement a control algorithm that translates the object's position in the image into velocity commands for the robot. For example, if the object is on the left side of the image, the robot should turn left.
    *   **Robot Control:** Publish velocity commands to the robot's motor controllers using ROS topics (e.g., `/cmd_vel`).
    *   **Evaluation:** Evaluate the robot's ability to accurately detect and follow the target object in different scenarios (e.g., varying lighting conditions, object distances, robot speeds).

**Software:**

*   Ubuntu Linux (recommended)
*   ROS (Robot Operating System)
*   OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
